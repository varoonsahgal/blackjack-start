//GameMonitor - remember this is the PORT that sits INSIDE the hexagon
// as an interface
// but in the adapter is where we provide the concrete implementation
//TLDR; we implement roundCompleted here and send data to the Database

//@Bean vs @Component: - at a high level these annotations do the same thing -
// they create Spring beans from whatever they annotate
// remember a Spring bean is just an object managed by Spring
// Java bean is an "old school" term, we don't really use them anymore
//@Bean can only be used on methods
//@Component can only be used at the class level

//you can only @Component when you have direct access to the class definitions
// when would you NOT have direct access to a class?
// when you are using 3rd party libraries - you would use a @Bean annotation instead
