        //

        //Question for later on the 2nd test case. To ensure the player busts I did
        //
       // Game game = new Game(StubDeck.playerHitsAndGoesBust(), gameMonitorSpy);
        //
        //
        //But StubDeck is protected by default so I had to move the GameMonitorTest to the domain package instead of the sub package port to access it. This breaks the logical separation. I think the better approach was to make the StubDeck methods public since itâ€™s only used for testing, maybe move into its own testUtil folder as well.

        //Wondering if others saw this issue and what would be the best approach.

        //
        // TODO: execute the behavior that you expect to call the GameMonitor
        //

        // verify that the roundCompleted method was called with any instance of a Game class
        // THIS IS THE HEART OF THE TEST:
        verify(gameMonitorSpy).roundCompleted(any(Game.class));
